          <h3>GATE WAY OF INDIA</h3>
          <p>Erected in the city of Mumbai in 1911, Gateway of India is one of the most popular places to visit in Mumbai. Built at Apollo Bunder port, it marked the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Mumbai, the first British ruler to visit India. However, they were only able to witness a cardboard exemplar of the original monument. The original structure only got sanctioned in August 1914. The construction was finished by 1924 and it was opened for the public on December 4th the same year.

              A former native fishing ground, Apollo Bunder became one of the most prominent spots for locals, hawkers, and photographers after the construction of Gateway of India in Mumbai.</p>
